# Analysis of Households with Negative Net Worth Using Data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances

This repository includes code used to analyze data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances regarding households with negative net worth. Estimates for various outcomes of interest were calculated for these households and then compared estimates for households overall. Select data is also exported to a CSV format to use for other purposes, such as plotting and manipulating in Excel.  This analysis was used to inform a report from the Aspen Institute, _100+ Solutions to Build Wealth from the Bottom Up: Pathways to a Future of Shared Prosperity_.
