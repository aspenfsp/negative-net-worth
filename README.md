# Analysis of Households with Negative Net Worth Using Data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances

This repository includes code written in the R script used to analyze data from the 1989, 2007, and 2019 waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) regarding households with negative net worth. This analysis was used to inform a report from the Aspen Institute, _100+ Solutions to Build Wealth from the Bottom Up: Pathways to a Future of Shared Prosperity_. 

SCF data was downloaded from the Federal Reserve's website: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm/. Estimates for various outcomes of interest were calculated for these households and then compared to estimates for households overall. Select data was also exported to a CSV format to use for other purposes, such as plotting and manipulating in Excel. 

The main estimates are contained in a presentable format in the file, "neg_nw_analysis". For the script that generated this file, see "neg_nw_analysis_script".
